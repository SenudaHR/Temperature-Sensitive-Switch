# Temperature-Sensitive-Switch
EN1190 Engineering Design Project

During my studies in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, I contributed to the development of a temperature-sensitive smart switch as part of the EN1190 Engineering Design Project. This device was designed to address energy waste caused by fans or appliances left running unnecessarily in homes and offices. 

The system uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity, paired with an ATmega328P microcontroller for automated control. A relay module enables switching, while an HC-05 Bluetooth module allows wireless communication with a custom Android app (developed in Kotlin). Users can set schedules, adjust temperature thresholds and remotely control connected devices for improved energy efficiency and convenience. 

Key contributions included hardware-software integration, sensor calibration and assisting in the development of the mobile app. Market research revealed strong interest in such a solution. 

This project strengthened my skills in embedded systems, IoT prototyping and collaborative engineering, while emphasizing practical solutions for sustainable living.

I had the opportunity to collaborate with Thejake Dissanayake, Nusaif Shehan and Ravindu Tennakoon as part of a team of four during our academic journey at the University of Moratuwa. Working together allowed us to strengthen our technical skills, problem-solving abilities and team coordination, while also building a strong foundation in collaborative engineering practices.
